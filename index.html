I learned how to right simple html as well as paragraphs. I still am unsure when to use body and html but I definetly am leaving with more knowledge then when I came in. Stuff that is still confusing is body and html. I can now write words for my website but thats my limit for websites. This language seems fairly simple but I have to learn most of the mechanics of it. In conclusion, I learned to write paragraphs but am still a little confused on when to put body and html. I hope to learn these skills and practice them in the near future.
